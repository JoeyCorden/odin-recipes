    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is french, it is soup. With a dash of onion. Let's get it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Yellow onions</li>
        <li>Beef stock</li>
        <li>Gruyere or Comte cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh + dried herbs</li>
        <li>White wine <em>and</em>Port (or Cognac)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm the oil over medium heat in a medium sized dutch oven, or heavy bottomed
            pot with a lid. Reduce heat to medium/low, add onions and cover for 15 minutes.
            Remove the lid and continue to cook the onions, stirring often, until a nice
            golden brown color is achieved. The caramelization process should take about
            30 minutes, donâ€™t rush it.</li>
        <li>Once the onions are caramelized add butter, nutmeg, thyme, bay leaf, 
            garlic, salt and pepper. Stir and cook for 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to high and add wine. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced by 
            half, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add stock, bring to a simmer and cook for an additional 45 minutes. Remove 
            thyme and bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Swirl in port, or cognac depending on which flavor you like more.</li>
        <li>Preheat broiler.</li>
        <li>Divide soup into 6 oven proof ramekins, or oven proof bowls. Top each serving 
            with a slice of bread and 1/3 cup grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Place under broiler until cheese is bubbling and, about 3-5 minutes. Garnish
             with some parsley or thyme, serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
